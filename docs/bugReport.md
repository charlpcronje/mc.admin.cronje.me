# Bug Report

When submitting a bug report on GitHub, it's important to provide detailed information about the issue to help the developers reproduce and resolve the problem effectively. Here's an example of how you can format your bug report:

## Title: [Web App Name] 

> **Bug Report**: [Brief Description of the Bug]

## Description

1. **Bug Overview**: Provide a concise summary of the bug you've encountered.
    
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Clearly outline the steps required to reproduce the bug. This should include a specific sequence of actions or inputs that trigger the issue. If possible, provide a minimal code snippet or a list of detailed steps.
    
3. **Expected Behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen when performing the steps mentioned above.
    
4. **Actual Behavior**: Explain what actually happened when you performed the steps. Clearly state the issue or discrepancy you encountered.
    
5. **Environment**: Provide information about your environment, including the web browser, operating system, and any other relevant details that might help with bug reproduction.
    
6. **Error Messages**: If you received any error messages, include them here. Copy the error message(s) exactly as they appeared, or provide a screenshot if applicable.
    
7. **Additional Context**: Include any additional information that might be helpful, such as recent changes or updates made to the web app, related issues, or any other observations that could aid in the debugging process.
    
8. **Priority**: If there's a specific priority level for your bug report (e.g., high, medium, low), mention it here. This can help the developers prioritize their work if they have multiple bug reports.
