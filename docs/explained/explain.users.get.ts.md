export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {This line defines an API endpoint handler function that will be executed asynchronously.

if (!isAdmin(event.context.user)) {This line checks if the user making the request is an admin.

return createError({statusCode: 401, message: "You don't have the rights to access this resource",});If the user is not an admin, a 401 Unauthorized error is returned.

const usersWithPassword: User[] = await getUsers();This line fetches all users with passwords from the database and stores them in the usersWithPassword array.

const usersWithoutPassword = usersWithPassword.map(user => {This line uses .map() to iterate over each user object in usersWithPassword.

const { password, ...userWithoutPassword } = user.properties;This line uses object destructuring to extract the password property into password and the remaining properties into userWithoutPassword.

return { ...user, properties: userWithoutPassword };This line returns a new user object with the password property removed.

});This closes the .map() method call.

return usersWithoutPassword;This line returns the array of users with the password properties removed.

The overall purpose of this code is to fetch all users, remove their password properties, and return the users to the API caller.

Please let me know if any part of this explanation needs clarification or expansion. I aimed to be as detailed as possible given the limited context provided.


```ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    if (!isAdmin(event.context.user)) {
        return createError({
            statusCode: 401,
            message: "You don't have the rights to access this resource",
        });
    }

    const usersWithPassword: User[] = await getUsers();
    const usersWithoutPassword = usersWithPassword.map(user => {
        const { password, ...userWithoutPassword } = user.properties;
        return { ...user, properties: userWithoutPassword };
    });
    return usersWithoutPassword;
