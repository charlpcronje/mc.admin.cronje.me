# Notion Database Reference

I had a long explanation in this reference but when I updated the types and added the objects

- [types](../types.ts)
- [objects](../objects.ts)

Everything is explained in those files, there is really nothing left to say, but if I find something I will add it below underneath the heading `I found something` below

## I found something

> Nothing yet, but if I find something I will add it here
